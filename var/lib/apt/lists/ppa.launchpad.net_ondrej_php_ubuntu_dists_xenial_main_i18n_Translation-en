Package: argon2
Description-md5: dbfc859504330ccc20cae13cd67faa2e
Description-en: memory-hard hashing function - utility
 Argon2 is a password-hashing function that can be used to hash passwords
 for credential storage, key derivation, or other applications.
 .
 There are two main versions of Argon2: Argon2i and Argon2d.
 Argon2i is the safest against side-channel attacks, while Argon2d provides
 the highest resistance against GPU cracking attacks.
 .
 Argon2i and Argon2d are parametrized by:
 * A time cost, which defines the amount of computation realized and
 therefore the execution time, given in number of iterations
 * A memory cost, which defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
 * A parallelism degree, which defines the number of parallel threads
 .
 This package contains the argon2 tool for hashing data on the command-line.

Package: graphicsmagick
Description-md5: 49dce754c724afc2a734936e7250be4b
Description-en: collection of image processing tools
 GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate
 image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers
 a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.
 .
 The tools support a large variety of image formats from the widely used
 jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or image
 formats found on some photo CDs. They can convert between formats,
 concatenate several images into one, annotate and distort them, create
 thumbnails or manipulate the colormap. While all features are available
 from the command-line, the package also includes an image viewer that
 allows interactive manipulation.
 .
 Note that unlike ImageMagick, the GraphicsMagick tools are accessed
 through a single executable called 'gm'. Therefore, GraphicsMagick and
 ImageMagick can be used in parallel. Install package
 graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat to obtain a set of several executables
 that is compatible to ImageMagick's interface.

Package: graphicsmagick-dbg
Description-md5: fcc436d75960b67f4f57213c969230ff
Description-en: format-independent image processing - debugging symbols
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or

 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbols for the gm executable as well as the
 C, C++, and Perl bindings. Tools like gdb and ltrace make use of these
 symbols.

 .
 The GraphicsMagick libraries are a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offer
 programming interfaces that are mostly compatible. While there might be
 small differences, experience tells that many programs only use a compatible
 subset and build fine with either GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick.
 .
 While GraphicsMagick uses different names for libraries, classes, and
 helper applications in order to coexist with ImageMagick, this package
 intends to minimise porting efforts by exporting the GraphicsMagick
 interface with the usual ImageMagick names. Note that this package only
 tries to provide build-time compatibility. Run-time libraries of
 ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick are incompatible and cannot be interchanged.
 .
 This package includes compatibility wrappers for the C, C++, and Perl
 libraries.

Description-en: format-independent image processing - C++ shared library
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.

Description-en: OpenPGM development files
 OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic General Multicast
 (PGM) specification in RFC 3208 available at www.ietf.org. PGM is a reliable
 and scalable multicast protocol that enables receivers to detect loss,
 request retransmission of lost data, or notify an application of
 unrecoverable loss. PGM is a receiver-reliable protocol, which means the
 receiver is responsible for ensuring all data is received, absolving the
 sender of reception responsibility. PGM runs over a best effort datagram
 service, currently OpenPGM uses IP multicast but could be implemented above
 switched fabrics such as InfiniBand.
 .
 This is the development package which contains headers and static libraries
 for the OpenPGM library.

Package: libxml2-udeb
Description-md5: d4368f9e5bef9306f3529146be42e634
Description-en: GNOME XML library - minimal runtime
 XML is a metalanguage to let you design your own markup language.
 A regular markup language defines a way to describe information in
 a certain class of documents (eg HTML). XML lets you define your
 own customized markup languages for many classes of document. It
 can do this because it's written in SGML, the international standard
 metalanguage for markup languages.
 .
 This is a minimal package for use in debian-installer that yields a
 library providing an extensive API to handle such XML data files.

Package: php-gettext
Description-md5: 403def874de6f8841d4a7707af10f20f
Description-en: read gettext MO files directly, without requiring anything other than PHP
 The GNU gettext library is a widely used localization library, but in
 order to use it with the PHP language, the system has to support the
 desired locale, and library itself must be installed.
 .
 Since this is not always the case, PHP-gettext has been developed to be
 able to read gettext MO files directly, without requiring anything other
 than PHP.
 .
 Currently, it's usable if you develop most of the infrastructure for
 choosing language on your own, because it's possible to use both
 gettext() and ngettext() calls. In the near future, it should also be
 fully compatible drop-in replacement for all of gettext functionality
 written in PHP.
